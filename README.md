## ARQ Setting up your Environment (ARQ does not include this repository)
An environment variable JENA_HOME is used by all the command line tools to configure the class path automatically for you. You can set this up as follows:

**On Linux / Mac**

* export JENA_HOME=the directory you downloaded Jena to
* export PATH=$PATH:$JENA_HOME/bin
